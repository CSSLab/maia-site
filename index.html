      <p style="margin-top:1cm;margin-left:0.5cm;"> Maia is an AlphaZero/Leela-like deep learning framework that learns from online human games instead of self-play. Maia is trained on millions of games, and tries to predict the human move played in each position seen.</p>
      <p style="margin-left:0.5cm;">We trained 9 versions of Maia, one for each Elo milestone between 1100 and 1900. Maia 1100 was only trained on games between 1100-rated players, and so on. Each version learned from 12 million
        human games, and learns how chess is typically played at its specific level.</p>

      <p>We measure “move-matching accuracy”, how often Maia’s predicted move is the same as the human move played in real online games.  </p>

      <p>Because we trained 9 different versions of Maia, each at a targeted skill level, we can begin to algorithmically capture what kinds of mistakes players at specific skill levels make – and when people stop making them. </p>

      <p>In this example, the Maias predict that people stop playing the tempting but wrong move <i>b6</i> at around 1500. </p>

            1500–1900
            predict that, on average, players rated 1500 and above will play the correct bxa6, forcing the Queenside open to

We ran various depth limits, ranging from only considering the current board (D01) to letting it search 15 plies ahead (D15). Depth-limited Stockfish is the most popular engine to play against for fun (e.g. the "Play with the Computer" feature on Lichess).</p>

          <p style="margin-left:0.5cm;text-align:justify"> Maia is particularly good at predicting human mistakes. The move-matching accuracy of any model increases with the quality of the move, since good moves are easier to predict. But even when players make horrific blunders, Maia correctly predicts the exact blunder they make around 25% of the time. This ability to understand how and when people are likely to make mistakes can make Maia a very useful learning tool.</p>

      <h4 style="margin-top:2cm">Abstract</h4>
      <p style="font-size:11pt;">

      As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly intelligent---in some cases, achieving superhuman performance---there is growing potential for humans to learn from and collaborate with algorithms. However, the ways in which AI systems approach problems are often different from the ways people do, and thus may be uninterpretable and hard to learn from. A crucial step in bridging this gap between human and artificial intelligence is modeling the granular actions that constitute human behavior, rather than simply matching aggregate human performance.

      We pursue this goal in a model system with a long history in artificial intelligence: chess. The aggregate performance of a chess player unfolds as they make decisions over the course of a game. The hundreds of millions of games played online by players at every skill level form a rich source of data in which these decisions, and their exact context, are recorded in minute detail. Applying existing chess engines to this data, including an open-source implementation of AlphaZero, we find that they do not predict human moves well.

      We develop and introduce Maia, a customized version of Alpha-Zero trained on human chess games, that predicts human moves at a much higher accuracy than existing engines, and can achieve maximum accuracy when predicting decisions made by players at a specific skill level in a tuneable way. For a dual task of predicting whether a human will make a large mistake on the next move, we develop a deep neural network that significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Taken together, our results suggest that there is substantial promise in designing artificial intelligence systems with human collaboration in mind by first accurately modeling granular human decision-making.
