    Maia is trained on millions of human chess games to predict the human moves
    at specific Elo levels.

  <p>Maia is an AlphaZero/Leela-like deep learning framework that learns from online human games instead of self-play</p>

  <p>Maia’s goal is to play the human move — not necessarily the best move</p>
</div>
<div class="slide_view">
  <p>We trained 9 versions of Maia, one for each Elo milestone between 1100 and 1900. Each version learned from 12 million human games.</p>

    <figcaption>In this position, Maia levels 1100–1400 correctly predict that White will play the tempting but wrong move b6 (the move
    played in the game). It threatens the Queen, but after …Qxc5 White’s big advantage is mostly gone. Maia levels 1500–1900
    predict that, on average, players rated 1500 and above will play the correct bxa6, forcing the Queenside open to
    decisive effect.

<p>We measure “move-matching accuracy”, how often Maia’s move is the same as the human move played in real online games</p>

    <p>We tested each Maia on 500,000 positions for each rating level between 1100 and 1900</p>
    <p><b> Maia captures human style at its specified skill level</b></p>
    <p>Lower Maias best predict moves played by lower-rated players, whereas higher Maias predict moves made by higher-rated players.</p>

  <p>Maia is fun to play and will help you learn how to get to the next level. It is an ongoing research project by a team at the University of Toronto, Cornell University, and Microsoft Research.</p>
